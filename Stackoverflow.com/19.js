Its apps connect consumers with local businesses for food takeout, hotel bookings, and movie tickets, among other services. In 2018, it acquired the bike-sharing company Mobike (since rebrand to Meituan Bike) to offer local transportation services as well. Meituan's tech platform uses data from its high-frequency applications to suggest its lower-frequency ones and inform users where to go next. The company is keenly focused on efficiency, finding new ways to make its delivery platform more cost-effective. Meituan's surfeit of data is also an asset to help digitize local businesses, informing where they might expand and finding gaps in the market for new restaurants or stores.&nbsp;In the first half of 2018, Meituan facilitated 2.77 billion in food delivery transactions alone for more than 350 million people in 2,800 cities.
